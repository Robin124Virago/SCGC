# Project Submission: Kubernetes Deployment Configuration

## Overview

This submission contains the necessary files for deploying an Nginx web server in a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment includes configuration for monitoring with Prometheus.

## Contents

- A folder named **Terminals for Each Task**: This zip file contains terminal recordings or screenshots for each task, providing a visual guide for setting up and deploying the Nginx server in Kubernetes.

- **OutsideTheCluster.yaml**: YAML file containing configurations for resources outside the Kubernetes cluster, such as external services or dependencies.

- **README.md**: You're reading it! This document provides an overview of the submission, where to find resources, dependencies, and special considerations.

- **nginx-config.yaml**: YAML file defining the configuration for the Nginx server.

- **nginx-deployment.yaml**: YAML file for deploying the Nginx server as a Kubernetes Deployment.

- **nginx-html.yaml**: YAML file containing HTML configurations for the Nginx server.

- **nginx-prometheus-exporter-service.yaml**: YAML file defining the service for Prometheus exporter for Nginx.

- **nginx-prometheus-exporter.yaml**: YAML file defining the deployment for Prometheus exporter for Nginx.

- **nginx-service.yaml**: YAML file defining the service for accessing the Nginx server within the Kubernetes cluster.

# Dependencies
- **Kubernetes cluster: Ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy resources.**

- **Prometheus: The configuration assumes Prometheus is already set up and running in the Kubernetes cluster for monitoring purposes.**

# Special Conditions

- **Monitoring: This deployment is configured to work with Prometheus for monitoring purposes. Ensure Prometheus is correctly configured and running in your Kubernetes cluster.**

- **Network Policies: If your cluster has network policies enabled, ensure that necessary policies are configured to allow communication between Prometheus and the Nginx exporter.**

- **Storage: Depending on your setup, you might need to adjust storage configurations for persistent data storage requirements.**

# Issues and Troubleshooting

- **If you encounter any issues during deployment or testing, refer to the terminal recordings/screenshots provided for each task. These visuals may help in identifying and resolving issues.**

- **Ensure that all configurations are correctly applied and that dependencies are satisfied within your Kubernetes environment.**
